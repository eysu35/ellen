 Do you ever enjoy the silence of a crowded space? I first had this thought on the green line, during a too-early morning commute. The season, relevant here, is winter. In the winter, Boston is unbikeable for most and unwalkable for all. Commuters become reliant on the various colors of public transportation, each more infamously unreliable than the next. When the city attempts repairs, the neverending closures and weekly replacement shuttle bus announcements only add to the headache, making an already overinflated topic of complaint reach new heights. 

  

Back on the green line, puffy jackets double, perhaps triple, the space each individual occupies. The rubbery floor is wet with snow and sleet and salt and dirt, forcing bags to stay on shoulders. Personal bubbles surrender to invasion. Sitters are eye level with crotches, standers shrink between the random arms reaching around them for the handgrip when the train, inevitably, lurches. Anyone brave enough to hold onto a coffee, a book (nevermind trying to read), or scroll on their phone is an optimist. The thing moves painfully slowly. Which is always a surprise given the highly disruptive start and stop. So here we are. Exhausted, cold but sweaty, crowded, touched, impatient, and dreading both another minute on this train and the arrival of another day at the office. Perhaps someone was secretly having a really great morning, but when I looked face to face that day on the green line, I only saw knit eyebrows and fatigue. I saw extremely low potentials for snapping should one’s neighbor lose balance into one’s space. 


Now imagine the scene I just described, but in perfect silence. Not global silence—the train itself was usually loud, and the announcements for each stop were characteristically honky. But the passengers were silent. I didn’t hear a word from Fenway to Park. The silence was comforting. It made me smile. What a ridiculous charade we are all participating in. What an act. The green line morning commute. We could have been on camera, given the textbook nature of this train car. I liked that we were all strangers sharing the same feelings. That we were unobliged and non performing, but our collective silence created the performance of the moment. I felt a sense of belonging in this silence; my individual effort to get to work was understood and shared by all of these strangers, as evident by everyone’s inability or disinclination to speak. Every day the green line runs. Taking students, teachers, parents, grandparents, friends, artists, academics, alike from A to B, to whatever excitements and stresses they have picked for themselves. Yet for a small moment, we are all subjugated to this crowded box. In this moment, and perhaps few others, I can empathize in part with every person around me. 


I could be romanticizing the subway. I’ll admit, I was the one having a really great morning. But whether it be transportation thoughts or the way observing the unperceived often leads to ambitious thinking, I was struck by how, to be a silent rider on the green line is to feel the effect of loneliness amidst camaraderie. The unique, or entirely universal, experience of being a human of humanity. Luckily, we are now approaching a station where this train will stop for service repairs, where we will wedge our way out, tumble back into our days, and do this once again.
