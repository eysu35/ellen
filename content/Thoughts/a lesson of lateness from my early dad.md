**My dad has always been early. Growing up, this quality of his had frustrated me. It meant that I was always late, relatively. I was the slow step, the waited on. 

  
  

To paint a picture. On college move out day, my dad would call me from where he was parked outside of my dorm room before I had even gotten up after the inevitable late night of goodbyes. I would scramble! I would throw clothes in suitcases and definitively random objects into bins. Somehow, it was always during move out that the staple removers, lint rollers, and extra phone wallets appeared and revealed themselves to be as irrelevant as they had been the year before (however, during this panicked hour of consolidation, between the trash can and the gallon plastic storage tote, they always made the cut. Mysteriously, their usability potential grows over the summer, and I would be glad to find my staple remover when unpacking in the fall. The cycle continued). I can recall this feeling distinctly. This one of sped up movements, catalyzed by the nearby presence of my early dad. 

  
  

Even today, I am sitting on a bus heading back to my apartment in Fenway, stuck in heavy traffic. My dad, on his way to pick me up for dinner, is speeding down Storrow Drive. His Find-My-Friends bubble, encompassing a capital D for dad, flashes green from the continuous live updates. He is determined to beat me to mine. I feel the familiar anticipation of a rush, followed by the visualization of the coming scene. The silver minivan will double parked outside. I will breeze through my apartment. Dropping bags, grabbing clothes, switching jackets, remembering keys. For the rest of the bus ride, I prepare for the sprint. 

  
  

Why rush and hurry? Over a few, tiny minutes of overlapping time? My answer is that no one is early anymore. Earliness is theoretically celebrated and practically ignored. We live in a time obsessed with time. It is easy to consider our own 24 hours as the rarest and most valuable commodity. It is easy to opt into the last task before heading out the door, and to commit to the risk that our company may wait. We do it to each other. We are late for our late friends to minimize the discrepancy between our arrivals. 

  
  

Our time epidemic has brought upon a lateness epidemic, and, as far as I can tell, my dad is the last man standing. He may be the only person in my life who consistently shows me that he values my time as much as his own. 

  
  

I have saved a mental image of my dad, standing at the kitchen counter, staring at the stovetop clock, calculating backwards in his head what time he has to leave so that his daughter will never be left waiting. I call this frame of stillness: love.**
