title: hi i'm ellen!

I am a first year PhD student at NYU. I work with [Todd Gureckis](https://todd.gureckislab.org/) in the [Computation and Cognition Lab](https://gureckislab.org/). I am interested in human and machine intelligenceâ€”in applying the tools of computer science to understand human cognition and citing the human mind to develop artificial intelligence systems. 

Previously at Princeton, I studied Computer Science with certificates in Applied Math and Cognitive Science. My senior thesis was advised by [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php) and explored how iterated learning can reveal the inductive biases of CNNs. 

I also love to [run](https://strava.app.link/wUsXaJj1cIb), [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/163690984-ellen-su), and cook!
