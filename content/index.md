title: hi!
---

I am a first year PhD student at NYU working with [Todd Gureckis](https://todd.gureckislab.org/) in the [Computation and Cognition Lab](https://gureckislab.org/). My current focus is on language in RL. 

My umbrella interest is intelligence! Of both humans and machines. My research applies computer science to understanding human cognition, and I hope insights into human thinking and learning will inform the development of sustainable AI systems. 

Previously at Princeton, I studied Computer Science with certificates in Applied Math and Cognitive Science. My senior thesis was advised by [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php) and explored how iterated learning can reveal the inductive biases of CNNs.
